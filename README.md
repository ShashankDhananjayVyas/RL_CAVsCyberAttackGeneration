# Cyber Attack Generation in Connected Autonomous Vehicles using Reinforcement Learning

We introduce cyber attack generation algorithm in Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) based on RL. We train an RL agent to learn attack vector consisting of (input, output) pairs in a model free RL setting. The file "main.py" contains the code for generating cyber attacks in the communication channels (input) and sensors (output) of a platoon of vehicles operating in Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC).
